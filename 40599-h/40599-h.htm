<p>Taking for granted the improbabilities of Mr. <span class="smcap">Author Jones's</span>
plot&mdash;which seems to use up again the materials of <i>Aurora Floyd</i>,
and one or two other novels, including
the <i>Danvers Jewels</i>&mdash;and a certain
maladroitness of construction, <i>Heart of
Hearts</i> is both interesting and amusing.
All the characters are distinctly outlined
excepting one, and this one,
strange to say, is <i>James Robins</i>, the
hero of the piece, a part apparently
written rather to suit Mr. <span class="smcap">Thomas
Thorne's</span> peculiarities, than to exhibit
any marked individuality of character.</p>

<p><i>James Robins</i>, <i>Lady Clarissa Fitzralf's</i>
butler,&mdash;who is of course the intimate friend of Mr. and Mrs. <span class="smcap">Merivale's</span>
butler at Toole's Theatre round the corner,&mdash;has secretly
married his mistress's sister, and her niece is openly to marry his
mistress's son. Now, how about the character of <i>James Robins?</i>
Is he honest? Hardly so. Is he sly? Certainly. Is he crafty? It
cannot be denied. Yet the sympathy of the audience is with him.
Why? Well, chiefly because he is played by Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>, and
secondarily, because he is very fond of his brother's child, whom he
has brought up because his brother, having got into trouble and been
compelled to "do his time," has delivered her into his care. This
nice father returns, comes to see his child, and steals a ruby bracelet,
this ruby being the "heart of hearts." Whereupon one <i>Miss Latimer</i>,
a malicious schemer, fixes the theft on <i>Lucy Robins</i>. What more
natural, considering the name? The father, <i>Old Robins</i>, has stolen
the jewel; the daughter, <i>Lucy Robins</i>, has been accused of doing so.
Quite a robbin's family. Of course exculpation and explanation
wind up the play, though I regret to say I was compelled to leave
before hearing how Mr. <span class="smcap">Authur Jones</span> deals with that old reprobate
Cock <i>Robins</i>, the parent bird, who, in view of the future
happiness of <i>Mary</i> and <i>Ralph</i>, would be about as presentable a
father-in-law to have on the premises as that old "unemployed"
reprobate, <i>Eccles</i>, in <i>Caste</i>. I am sorry he wasn't somehow disposed
of, having of course previously confessed his guilt to the bilious
detective, <i>March</i>, and expired under the assumed name of <i>Mister
Masters</i>. By the way, <span class="smcap">Authur Jones</span> is not happy in nomenclature.</p>

<p>The dialogue is good throughout, even when it only indirectly
developes character or helps the action, and so is the acting. Mr.
<span class="smcap">Thorne</span> as <i>James</i> is admirable; representing the character as a man
gifted with an overpowering appreciation of the humorous side of
every situation,&mdash;including his own as a butler,&mdash;in which either
accident or design may place him. I do not believe that this was the
author's intention, but this is the impression made upon me by Mr.
<span class="smcap">Thorne's</span> acting, and I am sure it could not be better played. Miss
<span class="smcap">Kate Rorke</span> is charmingly natural; Mr. <span class="smcap">Leonard Boyne</span> is unequal,
being better in the last Act than the first. My sensitive ear
having been struck by the mellifluous accents of <i>Lucy</i> and the
Corkasian,&mdash;I think, though, it may be Galwaisian,&mdash;tones of her
lover, I could not help wondering why the author, after the first few
rehearsals, did not slightly alter the dialect and lay the scene in
Ireland. The play is well worth seeing, and begins at the easy hour
of 8&middot;45. There should be <i>matin&eacute;es</i> of a new operetta, entitled <i>The
Two Butlers</i>, characters by <span class="smcap">J. L. Torne</span> and <span class="smcap">Thomas Thoole</span>.</p>

<h2>CORNET AND PIANO.</h2>

<h3>AT A JUVENILE PARTY.</h3>

<p><i>Cornet.</i> Ready? Yes, <i>I'm</i> ready&mdash;but I'm not going to begin
before I'm asked. If they want us to strike up, let 'em come and
ask us, d'ye see?</p>

<p><i>Piano.</i> Well, but there are all the children sitting about doing
nothing&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>C.</i> <i>Let</i> 'em sit! They'll see you and me sittin' all the evenin',
strummin' and blowin' like nigger slaves, and a lot they'll care!
Don't you make no mistake, young Pianner, there ain't no sense in
doin' more than you're obliged&mdash;you'll get no credit for it, d'ye see?
And don't keep that programme all to yourself. Ah, one Swedish,
one Sir Roger, and a bloomin' Cotilliong&mdash;<i>they</i>'ll take two hours
alone! We shan't work this job off much before one, you see if we do.
(<i>To Hostess.</i>) Commence now? By all means, Madam. Send us a
little refreshment? Thank you, Madam, we shall be exceedingly
obliged to you. (<i>The refreshment arrives.</i>) Here's stuff to put
liveliness in us, Mate&mdash;<i>Leminade!</i></p>

<p class="i6 hang">[<i>Puts jug under piano with intense disgust.</i></p>

<p><i>P.</i> Well, I should think you'd lemon enough in you already.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> I <i>'ate</i> kids, there&mdash;and that's the truth of it! It makes me
downright sick to see 'em dressed out, and giving themselves the airs
and graces of grown-ups. (<i>To Small Child.</i>) Yes, my little dear,
it's a worltz this time. (<i>To Pianist.</i>) Strike up, young P. and O!
(<i>A little later.</i>) I'm blest if I don't believe you're <i>enjoying</i> this,
Pianner, settin' there with that sort of a dreamy grin on your pasty
countinance!</p>

<p><i>P.</i> And if I am, where's the harm of it?</p>

<p><i>C.</i> It's easy to see you ain't bin at it long, or you wouldn't take
that interest in it. Much they thank you for takin' a interest, these
bloated children of a pampered aristocracy! Why, they don't mind
you and me more than the drugget under their feet. Even gutter
kids have got manners enough to thank the Italian as plays the
orgin for 'em to dance to. Are <i>we</i> ever thanked? I arsk you.</p>

<p><i>P.</i> The Italian plays for nothing. We don't.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> There you go, redoocin' everything to coppers. You're arguin'
beside the question, you are. Ever see a well-dressed kid give a
orgin a penny without there was a monkey a-top of it? <i>I</i> never did.
If you chained a monkey to your pianner now, they might condescend
to look at yer now and then&mdash;not unless.</p>

<p><i>P.</i> Well, you can't deny they're a nice-looking set of children
here. Look at that one with the long hair, in the plush&mdash;like a little
Princess, she is.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> And p'raps she ain't aware of it, either! Why, there's that
little sister o' yours, that's got hair just as long, ah, and 'ud look as
pretty too, if she'd a little more colour; but you can't have colour
without capital. It's 'igh-feeding does it all, and money wrung
from the working-classes, like you and me.</p>

<p><i>P.</i> I don't know what <i>you</i> call yourself. I'm a professional, and
see no shame in it.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> You can be as purfessional as you please, but you needn't be
poor-spirited. Come on; pound away! Ain't you got a uglier worltz
than that?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">At Supper.</span></p>

<p><i>C.</i> I must say I 'ardly expected this&mdash;after the leminade. But
you're eatin' nothin', young Pianner. (<i>To Servant.</i>) Thank 'ee,
my pretty dear, you may leave that raised pie where it is; and do
you think you could get us another bottle o' Sham, now&mdash;for my
young friend here? (<i>To Pianist.</i> You needn't think you've made
a conquest with that moony mug of yours. She's only lookin' after
you to make <i>me</i> jealous, d'ye see? I know these minxes' ways,
bless you.)</p>

<p><i>P. (with lofty bitterness).</i> I've no wish to dispute it with you.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> Ah, you've had <i>your</i> eye on the governess all the evening. I
saw you!</p>

<p><i>P. (blushing).</i> You're talking folly, Cornet, and what's more, you
know it.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> That's her playin' upstairs now. I know a governess's polker&mdash;all
tum-tum and no jump to it. Wouldn't you like to go up and
help her, eh?</p>

<p><i>P.</i> If I <i>am</i> a wretch doomed to misery, it's not for you to remind
me of it, Cornet. It's not a friendly act, I'm blowed if it is!</p>

<p><i>C.</i> You're a regular Tant&mdash;Tarantulus, you know, that's what
you are! You'll be goin' mad on your music-stool&mdash;"I saw her
dancin' in the 'All"&mdash;that sort o' thing, hey?</p>

<p><i>P. (with dignity.)</i> It seems to me you've had quite enough of that
Champagne, and we've been down half-an-hour.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> You don't 'pear to unnerstand that a Cornet's very mush
thirstier instrumen' than a iron-grand out o' tune&mdash;but you're a
good young feller&mdash;I li' a shentimental young chap. I'm a soft-'arted
ole fool myshelf!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">After Supper.</span></p>

<p><i>C. (with emotion.)</i> Loo' at that now, ain't that a sight to make
a man o' you? All these brit 'appy young faces. I could play for
'em all ni'&mdash;blesh their 'arts! Lor, what a rickety chair I'm on,
and thish bloomin' brash inshtrumen's gone and changed ends. Now
then, quicken up, let 'em 'ave it&mdash;you are a shulky young chap!</p>

<p><i>P.</i> It is not sulks but misery. I swear to you, Cornet, that each
hammer I strike vibrates on my own heart-strings!</p>

<p><i>C.</i> Then you can be innerpennant of a pianner.</p>

<p><i>P.</i> I am young&mdash;but the young have their sorrows, I suppose. Is
it nothing to have to minister to others' gaiety with a bitter pang in
one's own breast?</p>

<p><i>C.</i> Thash wha' comes o'shtickin' to the leminade!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Little Later.</span></p>

<p><i>P. (aghast).</i> I say, what <i>are</i> you about? You mustn't, you know!</p>

<p><i>C. (smiling dreamily).</i> It'sh all ri', dear boy! If a man fines he
can't breathe in 'sh bootsh&mdash;on'y loshical coursh 'fore him is to play

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">At Parting.</span></p>

<p><i>The Cornet (to hostess, with benignant tenderness.)</i> Goori', Madam,

here, and ah, 'undreds of young innoshent 'arts very 'appy, Madam,
you may ta' that from <i>me</i>. I hope we've given complete satisfaction,

<h2>A NEW YEAR'S CARD.</h2>

<p class="author"><i>Library, House of Commons,</i></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Honoured Sir</span>, <span class="author"><i>New Year's Eve.</i></span></p>

<p>I find in the Letter Bag a communication from that eminent
statesman <span class="smcap">Grandolph</span>. But I think it will keep for a week, and on
this New Year's Eve I will put in the Bag a letter of my own,
addressed to him who, take him for all in all, (as <span class="smcap">Bacon</span> wrote)
is the most Eminent Man of the century. No one, a cynic has
said, is a hero to his own valet&mdash;meaning, I suppose, that the closer
a man is looked into the less profound his valley appears. It has
been my lot to sit at your feet for close upon half-a-century, perched
upon the pile of volumes which, oddly enough, never grows an
eighth-of-an-inch higher through the revolving years. You have
honoured me with your closest confidence. I have known your inmost
thoughts. I have often seen you, as you are weekly presented to an
admiring public, chuckling with finger to nose and brightened eye
over the inception of a joke, and I have observed you afterwards a
little depressed on reading it in the proof, struck with the conviction
that it was not quite so good as you thought. I am not your valet.
But you are truly my Hero.</p>

<p>It may be said that I am prejudiced by receipt of personal favours.
You took me literally out of the streets to be your daily companion,
and, at friendly though still humble distance, to consort with the
Beauty and Brilliance that throngs your court. But for you I might
years ago have followed the historic precedent, gone mad to serve my
private ends, bit some unwholesome person and died. But you took
me by the paw, lifted me into your company, placed me on the pedestal
of your ever-increasing but never-swelling bulk of volumes, whence
it was an easy matter to step on to the lower level of the floor of the
House of Commons. The prestige of your name was sufficient to
secure for me the suffrages of one of the most important and one of the
most enlightened county constituencies of this still undivided Empire.</p>

<p>As I sit here alone in this dimly-lighted chamber there glide along
with silent footfall an interminable procession of familiar faces and
figures that have passed through this room since I first took the oath
and my seat for Barkshire. <span class="smcap">Dizzy</span> walks past, looking neither to the
right nor to the left, but conveying to the mind of the onlooker a
curious impression that he sees all round; and here comes kindly
<span class="smcap">Stafford Northcote</span> and burly <span class="smcap">Beresford-Hope</span>, and <span class="smcap">Tom
Collins</span>, with the faded umbrella he used to bring down through
all the summer nights and solemnly commit to the personal charge of
the doorkeeper. And there goes dear <span class="smcap">Isaac Butt</span>, wringing his hands
because of Major <span class="smcap">O'Gorman's</span> revolt, and <span class="smcap">W. P. Adam</span>, disappointed
after his long fight which ended with victory for his Party and something
like a snub for himself. Here is <span class="smcap">Newdegate</span> frowning at the
scarlet drapery of a reading lamp; and behind him, <span class="smcap">Whalley</span>,
wondering whether he was really in earnest when he denounced him
before the House of Commons as "a Jesuit in disguise." Here, too,
poor Lord <span class="smcap">Henry Lennox</span> with his trousers turned up, and
Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas May</span> with a Peerage looming within hand's reach, and
Captain <span class="smcap">Gosset</span> steering his shapely legs towards his room to drink
Apollinaris and read up Hansard. All, all are gone, the old familiar
faces, and the New Year, which the bell-ringers are waiting to
welcome in, is nothing to them. Over there in the corner are the
two chairs on which the form of <span class="smcap">Joseph Gillis</span> reclined on the first
all-night sitting that ever was, when, the thing being fresh to
Members, they were eager to stop up all night, to walk round the
recumbent form, dropping pokers and heavy volumes with innocent
attempt to disturb the slumberer. But <span class="smcap">Joseph Gillis</span> slept, or
<a class="pagenum" id="page_303" title="pg 303">[pg 303]</a>
seemed to sleep. He was giving the Saxon trouble,
and was not greatly inconvenienced himself.</p>

<p>I have taken down from the shelves two volumes among
the most recent and most prized addition to our Library,
and, turning over the leaves, come upon fresh testimony
to my Honoured Sir's prescience. Turning over <i>John
Leech's Pictures of Life and Character</i>, garnered from
the Collection of <i>Mr. Punch</i>, I find under date twenty-five
years back, women of all degrees presented under
cover of monstrous hoops. Everybody wore crinoline in
those days. It was the thing, the only possible thing,
and the average human mind could not grasp the idea
of there being any other way of arraying the female form.
But the prophetic eye of one of the most brilliant of
<i>Mr. Punch's</i> Young Men peered into the future and beheld
what was to come.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="r1">[1]</a></sup> In the very midst of delineations
of these everyday monstrosities, fearful in the
drawing-room, grotesquely exaggerated in the kitchen,
<span class="smcap">John Leech</span> flashed forth a view of the future. There
are three sketches of girls, two in the eelskin dress that
marked the rebound from the hideous tyranny of crinoline,
and the third showing a style of dress that might have
been sketched to-day in Bond Street, not forgetting the
upper rearward segment of the crinoline which survives
at this day to hint what has been. <i>Ex pede Herculem.</i>
It seemed at the date a monstrous idea, a nightmare
fancy, peradventure a joke. But <i>Mr. Punch's</i> calm eye
pierced the veil of the future, and saw then, as he has
always seen, what was to be.</p>

<p>This, Sir, is only a solitary instance of your prescience
cited in accidentally turning over the collected pages
that seem so familiar and are still so fresh. I could
quote indefinitely as I turn over the leaves. But time
is shorter than usual this evening. There is less than
an hour left of 1877. The procession I spoke of just
now has passed out and closed the doors. Under
brighter and more inspiriting auspices comes another
group. May I present them to my honoured Master?
<span class="smcap">Eighteen Eighty-Eight</span> this is <i>Mr. Punch</i> of whom
you may have heard. <i>Mr. Punch</i>, this is <span class="smcap">Eighteen
Eigthy-Eight</span> of whom I expect you will hear a good
deal. And here, happier in his possessions than <i>King
Lear</i>, are his four daughters&mdash;Spring, Summer, Autumn,
and Winter. They come to wish you a Happy New
Year in which no one joins so heartily as your humble
friend and servitor,

<h2>FROM A COUNTRY COUSIN.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Mr. Punch</span>,</p>

<p>I thank you for your advice. You were right when you
told me to go and see Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bernard Beere</span> in <i>As in a Looking
Glass</i>. Indeed, she does hold the mirror up to "nature,"&mdash;which is
in this instance what <span class="smcap">Zola</span> calls <i>la b&ecirc;te humaine</i>,&mdash;and in it is
reflected the worn face, so weary of wickedness and so hopeless of
the future, of <i>Lena Despard</i>. The moral of the story&mdash;for moral
there is&mdash;is never out of date. If we can ever retrace any of our
steps in life, which I doubt, there are at all events some false steps
that never can be retraced. Our deeds become part and parcel of
ourselves, and we can no more rid ourselves of them than we can
jump off our shadows.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>"Our deeds our angels are, or good or ill;</p>
<p>Our fatal shadows that walk with us still."</p>
</div>

<p>And yet <i>la b&ecirc;te humaine</i>, has not quite killed the soul of this adventuress,
for she is still capable of a real love, and of proving its
reality by an awful self-sacrifice. This is not a Christmas spirit, is
it? But you see I went before Christmas, and having done with
tragedy, I am looking forward to pantomimical stuff and nonsense.
I had not read the novel,&mdash;<i>you</i> have, but considerately refrained
from telling me the plot,&mdash;so I enjoyed the performance without my
memory compelling me to compare it, for better or worse, with the
original story.</p>

<p>I have never seen Mrs. <span class="smcap">Beere</span> play anything before this, nor have
I seen <span class="smcap">Sarah Bernhardt</span>, who, as you tell me, was in other pieces
this lady's model. A London Cousin of mine, who is a theatre-goer, and
knows several of the leading actors and actresses "at home," tells me
that in this piece the individuality of the actress is completely
merged in the part, and that it is only when she is saying something
very cynical, that he was reminded by a mannerism peculiar to
this actress how bitter this <span class="smcap">Beere</span> could be on occasion. It is a pity
her name is <span class="smcap">Beere</span>, because when I asked my cousin (do you know
him&mdash;<span class="smcap">Joseph Miller</span>?) if, off the stage, this lady was really thin
and tall, he replied, "Yes&mdash;Mrs. <span class="smcap">Beere</span> was never stout, and was
never a half-and-half sort of actress."</p>

<p>And then, when I pressed him for serious answer, he said, "Well,
she's <i>Lena</i> on the stage, as you see." What is one to do with a
joker like this, except go with him to a Pantomime, Burlesque, or
Circus?      <span class="author">Yours,       <span class="i6 smcap">Little Peterkin.</span></span></p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;The Op&eacute;ra Comique is not the Theatre for a <i>trag&eacute;dienne</i>.
Joe says, "Yes it is&mdash;for Mrs. <span class="smcap">Beere</span>, because of the 'Op in it."</p>

<p>On Thursday night, Mr. <span class="smcap">Wilson Barrett</span>, brought out a new
piece at the Globe, and in Leicester Square, the Empire Variety
Show was inaugurated. The good-natured "Visible Prince," who is
always ready to encourage Art in any form, and willing to "open"
anything from a Cathedral to an Oyster, was present at this <i>premi&egrave;re</i>
of the New Music Hall. Poor W. B! "How long! How long!"
By the way, it may be necessary to explain to some simple persons,
that <i>The Empire</i> has nothing whatever to do with The Imperial
Institute.</p>

<p>I have just come across something on Modern Wiggism in the
shape of an amusing advertising book on the Wigs supplied to
leading actors by the theatrical perruquier
<span class="smcap">Fox</span>. "Nothing like leather,"
said the tanner; and judging from the
collection of illustrations and notices,
it is, in Mr. <span class="smcap">Fox's</span> opinion, more what
is outside the head than what is in it,
that insures success on the Stage. The
perruquier makes the wig, and the wig
makes the actor. There are portraits
of various theatrical celebrities, including
one or two of Mr. <span class="smcap">Toole</span>, in
various wigs, whose presentments in
these pages may entitle the work to be called <span class="smcap">Fox's</span> <i>Book of Martyrs</i>&mdash;willing
martyrs, of course, and many of them after they've
strutted and fretted for several hours on the stage, quite ready to
go cheerfully to "The Steak."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frederick Barnard's</span> <span class="smcap">Character Sketches from Dickens</span>

<i>Mr. Pickwick?</i> No; let him ever remain the burlesque eccentricity
invented by Mr. <span class="smcap">Seymour</span>, and founded on <span class="smcap">Dickens's</span> creation.
But Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnard's</span> <i>Mrs. Gamp</i> and <i>Bill Sikes</i> are both quite truly

<h2>SOCIAL ROMANCE.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>A "Fragment," extracted from the "Dim and Distant Future," as
imagined by Mr. Frederic Harrison.</i></p>

<p>It was a delightful summer evening, and East London was looking
its brightest. The eight hours of daily toil were over, and the crowds
of cheery-voiced and happy-faced working people were returning in
merry groups to their respective homes, scattered here and there
amid the splendid Co-operative Palaces that reared their decorated
fronts to meet the last golden glories of the setting sun, and break
the soft progress of the gentle evening breeze laden with the sweet
scents of the myriad flowers blooming freshly amid the verdant
<i>parterres</i> and winding woodland walks by which they were divided
and surrounded. Here a rippling fountain made silvery music in
the air, while yonder the noisy brooklet could be traced cleaving its
headlong way to the lovely Thames flowing seaward tranquilly
beneath, its translucent surface being broken now and again only by
the leap from an occasional seventy-pound salmon revelling for very
joy in the highly hygienic quantity of the pure and crystal water in
which he was existing. Above was the faultless deep-blue glory
of an Italian sky. Beneath rare forest trees, amidst which the graceful
oleander and wild tamarisk flourished with all their native
strength, produced a grateful shade. So sparkling and smokeless
was the pervading atmosphere that merely to inhale it was a physical
pleasure. Sanitary and social science had indeed worked their
wonders here. East London had become to all those who dwelt amid
its fairy labyrinths a veritable earthly Paradise. And as he cast his
shapely but workmanlike frame with an elegant ease on to one of
the hundred comfortable lounges that at intervals fringed its green
swards throughout their entire length and breadth, no one in the full
flush of this glorious summer evening appreciated the fact more
keenly than did <span class="smcap">Jeremiah Halfinch</span>.</p>

<p>"Ah! this is delicious!" he cried, with enthusiasm; "just a few
moments' rest here to solve this problem, and then&mdash;<i>pour me rendre
chez moi!</i>" He spoke with all the easy grace and perfect <i>ton</i> of a
West-End <i>raconteur</i>, and as he opened his basket of tools and produced
from it a translation of a new work on German Philosophy, in
the pages of which he was speedily engrossed, it was impossible not
to be struck by his general appearance. His frame was that of an
Herculean Apollo, while his head, with its finely-chiselled features
and long tawny moustache, nobly set upon his shoulders, might have
belonged to a Captain in the Guards. There was in his eyes something
of the look of an intelligent Chief Justice, and whenever he
moved it was with all the commanding dignity of a Lord Mayor.
In short, it needed only a glance at <span class="smcap">Jeremiah Halfinch</span> to set him
down for what he was,&mdash;a fair specimen of the average type of the
working-man of the day.</p>

<p>He was not, however, destined to be long in solving his philosophical
problem, a light step on the gravel-path caught his ear.
He looked up. "Ah! Miss <span class="smcap">Betsy Jane</span>," he said, rising with a
courtly grace as his eye rested on the trim neatly dressed form of a
girl of nineteen; "so you, too, are enjoying the Elysian fragrance of
this lovely evening?"</p>

<p>The fair girl blushed slightly. She was very lovely. Her golden
hair crowned her beautifully shaped brow in broad deep bands.
Her mouth had that indescribable sweetness that is often met with in
those in whom a marvellously active intelligence is united to a strongly
poetic temperament. Her eyes were like two exquisite saucers of
liquid blue, from whose sapphire depths light and laughter seemed
to sparkle up unbidden with every variation of her mobile and ever
changing countenance. Yet she was only a poor work-girl making her
&pound;2 16<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week, under the new scale of prices, by button-holeing.</p>

<p>"I am enjoying the evening, for who would not, Mr. <span class="smcap">Halfinch</span>?"
she answered, half demurely, with a pretty pout, "but
I have just come from my Hydrostatic Class, and was thinking
of looking in at the Opera on my way home. They are doing
"<i>Tristan und Isolde</i>," and a little <i>Wagner</i> is such a pleasant close
to the day. Do not you think so?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I do," he answered eagerly, "and I will accompany you&mdash;that
is, if I may," he added, apologetically.</p>

<p>"If you <i>may</i>!" was the arch reply. In another minute they
were strolling leisurely along, side by side, towards the "Great
Square of Recreation," that was already scintillating in the distance,
lit up with the electric light as with the full blaze of day. As
they were emerging from the garden-path, they passed a small
child. She was carrying a little stone funereal urn, and she nodded
to them. They stopped for a moment.</p>

<p>"Why, <span class="smcap">Polly</span>, dear, what have you got there?" asked <span class="smcap">Betsy
Jane</span>, stooping down to kiss the child.</p>

<p>"Oh! it's only Great Grandmother," went on the little speaker,
volubly. "I'm fetching her from the <i>Crematorium</i>. She was only
<i>ashed</i> yesterday, you know, and father says he would like to have
her on the parlour chimney-piece as soon as possible; and so I am
bringing her home."</p>

<p>"Well, my little woman," threw out <span class="smcap">Halfinch</span>, kindly. "Take
care you don't drop your Great Grandmother, that's all."</p>

<p>"Oh no! I can carry her well enough," was the prompt response;
and little <span class="smcap">Polly</span> was soon bounding away across the grass merrily,
with her ancestral burthen.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">Betsy Jane</span> and <span class="smcap">Jeremiah Halfinch</span> had presented their passes
at the door of the Opera House, listened to an Act of <span class="smcap">Wagner's</span> incomparable
music, and were now once more coming homewards.
Their conversation had had a wide range, touching at one moment on
the Norse <i>Saga</i>, and at another on the Binomial Theorem; now on
the Philosophy of <span class="smcap">Epictetus</span>, and now on the latest speculations as to
the basis of Nebular Matter. They were deeply interested in their
talk, and it was not till they were suddenly arrested in their progress
that they became aware that their path was stopped by a Policeman
who was kindly stooping over a little child who was crying over
something she had dropped.</p>

<p>"Oh! it is little <span class="smcap">Polly</span>; and she has let her Great Grandmother
fall!" cried <span class="smcap">Betsy Jane</span>, much concerned.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I have spilled her; and father will be so cross!" added
the child in tears, pointing to the broken vase and to some white ash
that laid upon the gravel path.</p>

<p>"Never mind, my little woman, we will soon make it all right,"
<a class="pagenum" id="page_305" title="pg 305">[pg 305]</a>
answered <span class="smcap">Halfinch</span>, at the same time taking an evening paper
from his pocket, and carefully collecting the broken fragments of the
vase and its contents, and making them up into a neat parcel.
"There," he added, "he'll have to get a new vase. But you
may tell your father I think he'll find his Grandmother all there.
So wipe your eyes and get home as fast as you can."</p>

<hr />

<p>They watched the figure of the receding child.</p>

<p>"You don't have much work down this way nowadays?" inquired
<span class="smcap">Halfinch</span> amiably of the Policeman.</p>

<p>"Much work! Why, bless you, Sir, beyond occasionally running
in an Unemployed Sweater, we have none at all."</p>

<p>"Well, good night, Miss <span class="smcap">Betsy Jane</span>," said <span class="smcap">Halfinch</span>.</p>

<p>"Good night, Mr. <span class="smcap">Halfinch</span>," responded the lovely girl.</p>

<p>Then they each turned to their brilliantly-lighted Co-operative
Palace homes. Silence soon fell upon the scene. Another happy
East-End day had come to its luxurious close.</p>

<h2>UNCOMMON.</h2>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch</span> lately learned to his extreme
astonishment and delight that he is one of the
independent Electors of the Ward of Farringdon
Without. He gathered this important
information from the receipt of a highly
illustrated card from one of the numerous
candidates to represent him in that illustrious
body the Court of Common Council, during
the coming year, soliciting the honour of his
vote and interest.</p>

<p>The Candidate in question described at
length his various qualifications for the office
he sought. He kindly informed <i>Mr. Punch</i>
that he was a Citizen, a Loriner&mdash;whatever
that mysterious occupation may mean&mdash;and a
People's Caterer, and any doubt that might
have been entertained with regard to the
especial business for, which he catered was at
once removed by the perusal of the last line
of his canvassing card, which, after kindly
informing Mr. Punch that he had no less than
sixteen votes at his disposal, finished with the
remarkable request, "Kindly <span class="smcap">Plump</span> for your
Little <span class="smcap">Sausage Maker</span>!"</p>

<p>Naturally wondering why a little Sausage
Maker should be considered as so peculiarly
eligible for the office of Common Councilman,
that every elector should plump for him,
<i>Mr. Punch</i> again examined the mysterious
card, and found on its back a graphic representation
of a race for the "Pork Sausage
Derby," showing the Candidate, mounted on
a decidedly thoroughbred Pig, coming in an
easy winner with the rest nowhere, amid the
chorus of the surrounding multitude.</p>

<p>Doubting whether a Large Tripe Dresser,
or a Middle-sized Mutton-Pieman, would not
have equal claims upon his Plumper to that
of a Little Sausage Maker, <i>Mr. Punch</i> decided
to take no part in the Election for Common
Councilmen until the real meaning of the
word "Common" is better understood than it
evidently is at present by some aspirants to
the Office in question.</p>

<h2>DOLL-CE DOMUM.</h2>

<p>One of the prettiest and most seasonable
sights we have seen for a long while was the
display of toys collected by the proprietor
of <i>Truth</i> from the readers of that entertaining
periodical, exhibited in Willis's Rooms
before distribution amongst the children of
our hospitals and work-houses. The dolls
(there were thousands and thousands of
them) seemed to be bidding the fashionable
world adieu before entering, like so many
Sisters of Mercy, upon a mission of tender
charity to the sick poor. There was a
private view on Sunday, a week before
Christmas Day, and those who examined
the treasures revealing the glories of Regent
Street and the Lowther Arcade, could not
help thinking "Mr. <i>Labouchere</i> must have
a heart as good as his head, and be a very
kind man <i>au fond</i>." We wonder whether
that confirmed cynic, the proprietor of
<i>Truth</i>, would make the same admission?</p>

<hr />

<p>The reasons given in the correspondence
published in the <i>Times</i> of last Thursday for
discharging Mr. <span class="smcap">Highton</span> from his offices in
connection with the Westminster Play seem
to us inadequate. Instead of his work
tending to lower the tone of the performance,
surely its effect would obviously be to
Highton it.</p>

<hr />

<p>Of course <span class="smcap">Smith</span> and <span class="smcap">Kilrain</span> passed their
Boxing-Day together.</p>

<p>I begins to feel as how the older one gits the more a little bother
seems to worry him. There was a time when I could look bothers in
the face with the same carm look as I lissens
to a gent when he tries to perswade me as
how as that port isn't '47 Port, but them
times is gorn I'm afeard, never to return.</p>

<p>My present bother came upon me amost
like a moderate size thunderbolt, and was
summut in this way. The Manager of one
of my best Hotels took me into his privet
room, one day larst week, and had sum
werry sollem tork with me. He was werry
kind, and werry considerate, but he was
also werry furm, and what he said was
summut like this:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You see, <span class="smcap">Robert</span>," said he, "things is
a changing in Hotels as is amost all other
things, and all things as is jest a leetle
old fashoned and a leetle rusty, as it were,
must be jest pollished up a bit, and made a
little fresher like. Now take our Hotel, for
xample. See what lots of forren gents comes and stays here, and
many on 'em so orful ignorant that they carnt not hardly speak a
word of Inglish! Well, if they arsks one of our Hed Waiters a
plain common question in French, which they all on 'em seems to
know how to tork, they natrally expecs a anser. Now, what French
do you know?"</p>

<p>I confess I was so taken aback at the suddenness of the question,
that I was amost speechless. But I pulled myself together, like a
man and a Hed Waiter, and said, "Not werry much, Sir, but when
I was in Brussels two years ago, witch, I bleeves is sumwheres in
France, I lernt jest a few words from the gassons at the Flarnders
Hotel, witch I have treasured up in fond memory, and may find
usefool sumtimes." "Oh," said he, "I didn't know you had
travelled, so perhaps you will be able to manage."</p>

<p>I didn't think it worth while to tell him that I had only been in
Brussells two days, and that it rained all the time, as I was told it
amost always does there, hence so many Brussells Sprouts, but I at
wunce made up my mind to strike up a closer acquaintence with one
of our yung French Waiters to himprove myself in his tung, and
himprove him in ours. And I'm getting on quite wunderfool. Why,
ony yesterday a forren gent said to me, "Encore de Pulley, Gasson!"
to which I at wunce replied, "Be hanged! Mossoo," and took him
some. I was a good deal emused at his calling me a boy, but my
young French friend told me as it was only their way, and didn't
mean no offense, so I forguv him. But wot a langwidge! to encore a
biled chicking as if it was a comick song! Of course I sumtimes
makes mistakes, who woodn't? Last Munday, for instance, a
forrener asked me for some raisins, and of course I took him some
and some armonds with 'em, but he larfed quite artily, and kindly
sed, "I sink as you calls 'em grapes," but wot ignorance, not to
know one from the other!</p>

<p>I find too, werry much to my discumfort and worry, that I am
xpected to bussel about jest as if I was the mere boy as the French
gents calls me, witch is of coarse so werry different to what I have
for so many years bin akustomed to in the dear, old, quiet, respecktable
City, that I sumtimes wunders whether I shall be able to stand
it for long. Another thing too as I misses terribly, is the hutter
habsence of Toastes. No loyal Toastes, nor no Army and Navy and
Wolluntears, and no blushing Churchman's helth, nor no Lord
Mayor's helth, but dreckly as they've dun their dinner away they
goes to the Play or some such frivolus emusement, insted of setting
for ours and ours over their wine, and lissening with rapshure to the
long speaches, as full of wit as they is of wisdom, which has made us
what we are, the sollemest, and the most respectablest, and the
most diningoutest peeple in Urope, and the best frends to the pore
hardworking Waiters of any other nation.</p>

<p>What a glorious free-drinking race we must have bin in days gone
by! How one's respect rises up when one hears of a digneterry of
the Church who lived to the green old age of 80, becoz he always
drunk a bottle of old port every day of his life from his youth upwards.
How artily I wish I coud afford to foller his brillyant
xampel! and so gain the profound admiration of my fellow men, as
he did. Why, to such a man his dinner must have bin to him the
one great object of his life, as it ort to be to every reel Gentleman.
My son <span class="smcap">William</span>, who is a good calculator, tells me that this trewly
reverend Diwine must have drunk a hole Pipe of Port ewery two
years of his life! What a time of it his rewerend Butler must have
had!      <span class="author smcap">Robert.</span></p>

<h2>SWIVELLERIANISM.</h2>

<p>From the Police Reports we have discovered that there is a
Society called "The Social Trumps." What a Swivellerian title!
The dispute which made these trumps Police Court Cards turned
on a question of money, and the Magistrate, Mr. <span class="smcap">Lushington</span> (could
there have been a more significantly appropriate name for a justice
having to decide a Swivellerian case?) recommended the Social
Trumps to settle their little difficulty amicably among themselves.
We hope the Trumps went and had a jolly blow out together,
enlivened with songs about "The Rosy" and "Glorious Apollo,"
and sentiments to the effect that none of them "might ever want a
friend or a bottle to give him." The "Social Trumps" must be
enjoying their Christmas festivities. Their Christmas, of course, is
The King of Trumps.</p>

<h2>CHRISTMAS CRIMES.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Dedicated to the unfortunate Concocters of Sensational Leading Articles.</i>)</p>

<p>"A merry Christmas! And why not a Merry Christmas, we
should like to be informed? Is it not far better to be joyous and
mirthful than to be&mdash;&mdash;" (&amp;c. Supply vigorous epithets here). "A
black-souled tyrant like <span class="smcap">C&aelig;sar Borgia</span> could, no doubt, spend his
Yule-tide in&mdash;&mdash;" (&amp;c., &amp;c. Invent some revolting anecdote about
<span class="smcap">C&aelig;sar B.</span>) "Yet even those insufficiently clad progenitors of ours,
the ancient Druids, seem to have understood as though by instinct
the solemn nature of the season which to-day ushers in, and in what
Mr. <span class="smcap">Freeman</span>&mdash;&mdash;" (or was it Lord <span class="smcap">Tennyson</span>? Never mind&mdash;chance
it!)&mdash;"calls the 'dateless dawn of history,' they first employed
the mistletoe bough for ritual, and perhaps even for osculatory,
purposes, and habitually gave themselves an extra coat of paint on
the 25th of each recurrent December. And who can blame them?"
(Recollect that interrogatories, addressed to nobody in particular,
add force to a style.) "What though our modern Yule-tide ceremonies
are a mere survival of&mdash;&mdash;" (Here bring in anything you know about
the Roman Saturnalia, say something pretty about holly being
Scandinavian, and that "Waits" were quite common in Athens in
<span class="smcap">Sophocles'</span> time, especially on the stage. Then go on triumphantly
and truculently, as if you had proved your point down to the ground)&mdash;"What
difference does it make? It is the great holiday of the
Winter&mdash;&mdash;" (This will be a novel idea to most of your readers.)
"For the children, who gather round the cheerful fire, and listen to
the ghost-story invented by some eloquently mendacious uncle,
the season positively sparkles and scintillates with happiness."</p>

<p>"How exquisitely pleasant it is to hear the childish voices," &amp;c., &amp;c.
(to any amount).</p>

<p>"Even for the elders, too, there is a mirth and joy about the
Sacred Season, as they calmly retire to their beds just when the
row down-stairs is becoming unbearable, and locking their doors,
look carefully round the room to see that the jug is filled in readiness
for the midnight serenaders of this blissful time.</p>

<p>"When <span class="smcap">Dickens</span> drew his immortal picture of&mdash;&mdash;" (&amp;c., &amp;c. Here
gush at length about <i>Gabriel Grubb</i>, <i>Tiny Tim</i>, and anybody suitable,
from <i>The Christmas Chimes or Carols</i>), "or when <span class="smcap">Washington
Irving</span> depicted the more than feudal merry-makings at"&mdash;&mdash;(&amp;c.,
&amp;c. Try to cook up as much about <i>Bracebridge Hall</i> as you
think the public will stand. Perhaps a few practical words at the
end would be advisable, as follows):&mdash;</p>

<p>"And after our traditional Yule-tide offerings are over; after the
preposterous claims of the postman and the lamp-lighter have been
liquidated by liquor or satisfied by sixpences; then can we forget
that besides this private bounty we also have a duty to our country?
Lives there the man with soul so dead, Whose heart within him has
not bled, And who, quite promptly has not fled, at mention of that
grandest of Nineteenth Century inspirations, the Jubilee Imperial
Institute? The Imperial Institute is&mdash;&mdash;" (Here mention what it
is. If you don't quite know, you can count upon none of your
readers being any the wiser. Then add appeals for cash, a few more
Yule-tide common-places, and a general and genial wind-up.)</p>

<p class="hang">SCENE&mdash;<i>A snug and sequestered if cloudy corner of the Elysian Fields. Present, the Shades of</i> <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Bacon</span>, <i>engaged in
reading</i> Mr. <span class="smcap">Donelly's</span> <i>egregious lucubrations, not without such mild and mitigated mirth as becomes the locality. To them
enters a small and sprightly Personage, light-footed, but of seeming cis-Stygian solidity.</i></p>

<p><span style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle;">
<i>Bacon</i><br />
<i>Shakspeare</i></span>
<span style="font-size:2em; display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle;">}</span>
<span style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle;">(<i>together</i>). Hillo!</span></p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> <i>That</i> sounds human. Savours rather of my own Fleet Street than of the realms of the <i>other</i> Rhadamanthus.
What cheer, sweet <span class="smcap">Will</span>? How fare you, Brother <span class="smcap">Francis</span>?</p>
<p class="i6 hang">[<i>Salutes courteously.</i></p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> 'Twere affectation to ask <i>who</i> you are, Sir. The question, "How gat you here?" may perchance be more
pertinent&mdash;and pardonable.</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> (<i>airily</i>). Oh, I had been for&mdash;say, the <i>x</i>th time&mdash;to see "Our <span class="smcap">Mary</span>" in <i>The Winter's Tale</i>, and being more
inclined for profitable talk than for sleep, I just took you on my way home.</p>

<p><i>Bacon</i> (<i>smiling</i>). Marry, Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch</span>, were the statement of sequence equivalent to the explanation of causation, yours
would be a most satisfactory answer.</p>

<p><i>Shaks.</i> (<i>mildly</i>). Be not too scientifically scrutinising, Brother <span class="smcap">Bacon</span>. Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch</span>, <i>Puck</i> and <i>Ariel</i> in one, is free of
all places, lord of all latitudes, penetrator of all spheres, permeator of all elements.</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> True, sweet <span class="smcap">Will</span>! How much more catholic, in comprehension, as in charity, is the creative mind than
the merely critical one!</p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> Humph! That sounds Sphinxian. <span class="smcap">Heraclitus</span> the Obscure was pellucid in comparison.</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> And yet, I warrant you, Master <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span> here could play the "Diver of Delos" where your pundit's
plummet should not find bottom. However, "broad-browed <span class="smcap">Verulam</span>," let not that brow's breadth cloud or corrugate in
vexation at my persiflage. What do you read, Sir?</p>

<p><i>Shaks.</i> "Words, words, words!"</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> "I mean the matter that you read."</p>

<p><i>Shaks.</i> "Slanders, Sir." For the coney-catching rogue&mdash;one <span class="smcap">Donelly</span>&mdash;says here&mdash;&mdash;but of course you know <i>what</i>
he says.</p>

<p class="i6 hang">[<i>The trio laugh Homerically, until the asphodels wag their white heads and convulse their starry corollas in sheer
sympathy.</i></p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> By <span class="smcap">Democritus</span>, laughter in these latitudes is seldom enough of this sort and compass.</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> To succeed in shaking the sides&mdash;of <span class="smcap">Bacon</span>, <i>here</i>, is somewhat indeed, the greatest triumph, be sure, that
awaits the incongruous Cryptogrammatist.</p>

<p><i>Shaks.</i> Would that <span class="smcap">Ben Jonson</span> were with us to join in the glorious guffaw.</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> Conceive Rare <span class="smcap">Ben</span> being jockeyed into accepting <i>you</i>, his contemporary and tavern-companion, as the author
of such "unconsidered trifles" as <i>Hamlet</i> and <i>Lear</i>, <i>Othello</i> and <i>Macbeth</i>, <i>The Tempest</i> and <i>The Midsummer Night's Dream</i>!
Wer't ever at the "Mermaid," <span class="smcap">Verulam</span>?</p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> Verily, Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch</span>, I should like mightily to have joined in that company, just for once, and to have discussed
<a class="pagenum" id="page_316" title="pg 316">[pg 316]</a>
the Cryptogram with the "Spanish great galleon" and the "English man-of-war" (as <span class="smcap">Fuller</span> puts it), whom <span class="smcap">Donelly</span> now
desires to knock, as it were, into one curiously composite craft. Did not this same maker of mare's-nests indite a fantastic
tome, full of bottomless argument and visionary particularity, concerning that fabled island or continent of Atlantis, which
the Egyptian priest told <span class="smcap">Solon</span> had been swallowed up by an earthquake?</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> Like enough, my Lord, like enough. Once a mare's-nester, always a mare's-nester. Nephelo-Coccygia was
<i>terra firma</i> compared with the elaborate but evanescent Cloud-Cuckoolands of riddle-reading theory-mongers.</p>

<p><i>Shaks.</i> When <span class="smcap">&OElig;dipus</span> gets crotchet-ridden the sooner the Sphinx devours him the better.</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> True, O Swan! Let the Great Brethren of British Genius be brethren still&mdash;twins, if you please, but twain.
Verily it might almost pass the might of Mother Nature to round two such splendid orbs into one. Rare <span class="smcap">Ben</span> had his tribute
for you also, my <span class="smcap">Verulam</span>. "No man ever spake more neatly, more purely, more weightily, or suffered less emptiness, less
idleness in what he uttered." Might have been said of <span class="smcap">Me</span>!</p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> Praise shared with you is praise indeed! But the language of the Realm of Phantasy&mdash;<span class="smcap">Will's</span> own world&mdash;the
speech of Arcady, of Arden, of shadowy Elsinore, of <i>Prospero's</i> enchanted Isle&mdash;<span class="smcap">Will's</span> native tongue&mdash;passeth many a
league-long step beyond the "neatness" of the judgment-seat, or the "fulness" of the <i>Novum Organum Scientiarum</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> Well said, Wisdom!</p>

<p><i>Shaks.</i> (<i>chortling softly</i>). Why, who knows? One day, perchance,&mdash;&aelig;ons hence, of course,&mdash;some puzzle-headed
pragmatist may propound the preposterous question, "Who wrote <i>Punch?</i>" From out the fathomless deeps of its many
thousand wit-stored tomes the <span class="smcap">Donelly</span> of that dim and distant future may readily dip up, in his poor bucket, a Cryptogram,
to show that they were produced by a scientific syndicate, including <span class="smcap">Faraday</span> and <span class="smcap">Mill</span>, <span class="smcap">Huxley</span> and <span class="smcap">Herbert Spencer</span>,
<span class="smcap">Darwin</span> and the Duke of <span class="smcap">Argyll</span>.</p>

<p class="i6 hang">[<i>At the mention of the Olympian and autocratic Scottish Sciolist, Homeric laughter
bursts forth anew in yet fuller force.</i></p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> Prithee, sweet <span class="smcap">Will</span>, don't! Shadowy sides can ache, I find, and then, what will Rhadamanthus think?</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> As Jupiter did when the adventurous Ixion intruded into Olympus, perhaps. Well, well, put aside that
preposterous book, which, as you, my Lord <span class="smcap">Bacon</span>, said of the Aristotelian method, is "only strong for disputations and
contentions, but barren of works for the benefit of the life of man," and, I may add, of immortals.</p>

<p><i>Shaks.</i> (<i>yawning</i>). Not all reading, my <span class="smcap">Francis</span>, makes a full man&mdash;save in the sense in which one may be filled
with the East wind. <i>My</i> books were men. Not much that is novel in Nature, human or otherwise, to study in these
shadowy realms. I miss the "Mermaid," and the mazy world which was my stage. <span class="smcap">Donelly's</span> book is dull, however.
Canst furnish us with a substitute, excellent Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch</span>?</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> That can I, sweet <span class="smcap">Will</span>. To that end indeed came I hither. As a popular stage-character&mdash;not one of
your own&mdash;saith, "I hope I don't intrude." Ah, I thought not; but you needn't try (ineffectually) to wring my hands off,
the pair of you. Behold!!!!!!</p>

<p>As Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch</span> reluctantly turned his back upon Elysium, he left the two Illustrious Shades, prone side by side and
cheek by jowl upon an asphodel bank, eagerly and diligently perusing his</p>
